A One-Shot Requested by a friend

## The Setting
### Overview
The sleepy farming town of Harvest Crossing Valley; Or just Harvest to the locals and HCV to the cool kids… probably. Probably the gayest farming town ever. Rumor has it that's why y'all moved in.
A Modern-ish rural fantasy setting where magic and darkness lurk just out of sight of everyday life.

### Principals

### Setup Questions
### Custom Relationships?
## Campaigns
### Save Our Farm
Hazel's farm is running behind on payments. The livestock hasn't been doing well at all and is going to collapse. Can we save this staple of our town or are we going to lose another local farm lost to the bank and sold to the agri-food megacorp PentexAg?

### The Cult
There are a lot of mysterious sounds coming from the sewers when it rains. They say it's all just gas escaping and animals but several people have been seen meeting at XXX's house under the shroud of darkness, far later than any self-respecting farmhand would be out. And everybody is denying it vehemently.

### And Don't Comer Back Yall Ya Hear?
## Characters
**"Mayor" Sylvana Book (she/they):** People in town call her "Mayor Book" because she's the real one who runs this town. As the head of the local bank, Ms. Book has money invested in everybody's land and farms. Just about everybody has a loan through her.
She's not a cold and uncaring person though, in fact, this portly woman is always a burst of sunshine and warmth to everybody she meets.
They say her smile only breaks when the money is late.
She really does seem to care about the town and its farms, but it's hard to ignore the fact she gets all her investment money from PentexAg, a company that would be more than happy
