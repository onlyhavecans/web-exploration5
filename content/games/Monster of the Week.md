## Keeper Agenda & Principles
Refresh before every game [Keeper Agenda and Principles](x-devonthink-item://76A6BF4E-A42B-4D27-A023-C47B0A0B6D64?page=132)

### Your Agenda is Made up of Three Elements
- Make the world seem real.
- Play to see what happens.
- Make the hunters' lives dangerous and scary.

### The Keeper Principles
The twelve specific ways to apply your agenda
- Put horror in everyday situations.
- Address yourself to the hunters, not the players.
- Use the Keeper moves, never use their names.
- Be a fan of the hunters.
- Build up a coherent mythology of the world as you play.
- Nothing is safe. Kill bystanders and minions, burn down buildings, let monsters be slain.
- Name everyone they meet, make them seem like normal folks.
- Ask questions and build on the answers.
- Sometimes give the hunters exactly what they earned, rather than everything they wanted.
- Think about what's happening off-screen.
- You don't always have to decide what happens.
- Everything is a threat.

## Six Basic Elements of Story
A mystery is made up of six basic elements.
You can create them in any order, but I'll show you the order I usually use:

- A basic concept for the mystery.
- The hook that got the hunters' attention.
- The Threats
    - Monster ([Stats and Types](x-devonthink-item://76A6BF4E-A42B-4D27-A023-C47B0A0B6D64?page=139))
    - Minions
    - Bystanders
    - Locations
- The mystery countdown.
- Optionally: custom moves for special aspects of the mystery.

## First Mystery
The first mystery is going to be everyone's introduction to the hunters and to your game's world. Build a straightforward hunt, to give the hunters space to talk and get a sense of how the team operates. Pick a classic monster that everyone will recognize from folklore, urban legend, or pop culture.

Once you have a monster, come up with a basic concept. Think about what the creature could want, and what bad stuff is going to happen if the hunters don't stop it. The bad stuff might be personal, local, or apocalyptic in scale.

## MotW Session Zero

- [End of Session Routine]({{% relref "End of Session Routine" %}})

## End of Session Move
Ask the following and depending on how many completed everybody gets: 1-2 = 1 exp, 3-4 = 2 exp.

- Did we conclude the current mystery?
- Did we learn something new and important about one of the hunters?
- Did we learn something new and important about the world?
- Did we save someone from certain death (or worse)?

Ask everybody if they have plans for what to do next or ideas for later.

Think about whether the mystery gave you more ideas for your existing arcs, or suggested a new one.
