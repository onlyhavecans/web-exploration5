_From [Mortaine training class on PbtA GMing]({{% relref "Powered by the Apocalypse" %}})_

Brindlewood Bay has a two-page scenario page. Which is about twice that of a normal Powered by the Apocalypse game one.

In Brindlewood (as well as Jinkies), there is no answer to the mystery, the players come up with it. They need to come up with something that matches the clues and roll for it.

All NPCs are Suspects and all Suspects are NPCs

Void happens when meddles and rolls really well.

For the first session or two, don't work on your void conspiracy. One-shots will not usually jump into the void

In Roll 20 Keep a central shared clue sheet, assign a single scribe to prevent chaos

There are no secret clues, the mavens share all.
