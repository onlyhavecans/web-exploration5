## Takeaways
- Remember, the whole game is the players telling their stories.
- Be a huge fan of the characters.
- Tie in all plots against the character's backstories.
- Let the players drive the story, don't be attached to any antag/plotline.
- TSL works well as an NPC-forward game where you want to make characters they'll be smitten with.
    - Keep all the antagonists in fem/nb/player alignment.
    - Tie in all the antagonists emotionally to the character's core concepts and backgrounds. (dated, fought, etc.)
    - Keep the antagonists flirty.
    - Make **every single antagonist encounter meaningful**, with no trash mobs and no drop in battles. Make anybody the players cross somebody they would cross swords with in a heated way.
- Put players in positions where fighting is usually not the obvs answer, and encourage other moves.
- Use the playbook challenges for GMs listed in TSL, and keep them close.
    - Refer to the character's core problem on a down beat.
- With "defy disaster," ask what they risk sacrificing FIRST.
- Keep players' special hooks and abilities close to help encourage them.
- Have the toxic powers be toxic powers without having to bring misogyny, racism, etc., into it.
- Dig into conditions, make them emotional, and with a significant impact, play them up.
- Figuring someone out is usually something that is Intuited IC, not asked out loud.
- Having antag get strings on something for later is better than losing something abstract.

## TSL Campaign Flow
Stephanie's Mini Campaign Setup: 4 sessions, one (free) session zero and three
 standard sessions.
Then take a break.
Let people hop about at this point and swap out game parts.

Missing from the one-shot flow is going over the campaign setup document and letting people pick out the world parameters. This replaces a lot of the Game Style and Tone sessions. Let the players pick it.

## Game Prep
- Set up Roll20 or print out everything
- Get the Relationship Questions & GM Moves
- Get the Handouts for game start and world build.

### One Shot
Give them a goal that can be achieved in a one-shot: a threat, or a toxic power that can be struck down. Surround them with sexy villains and a sexy ally or two.

## TSL Session Zero
- [Session Zero]({{% relref "Session Zero" %}})
- Go over the [TSL World Building Worksheet]({{% relref "TSL World Building Worksheet" %}}).
- Explain and guide the character setup
    - Discuss each player's playbook conflict and primary move.
    - Go over sword importance.
- Ask for any Pre-Relationship tasks in playbooks.
- Character relationship setting
    - Round robin through all three questions
    - Encourage but not force variety in answers.
    - Spend a bit on each question.
    - Make sure it's two-way consensual, and have both players expand on it!
    - Let players grant any extra strings (two max)
- Have a ten-minute break here.

## TSL Session
- Ask for any start of session moves
- Ask for any start of scene/new area moves
- Action flow
    - Have the characters say what they want to do
    - Decide the pick the playbook move and modifier.
    - Ask them what they are risking.
    - Describe what they are doing for it
    - Only then roll
- When you have about an hour left in your session, work towards a dramatic moment that can serve as a climax for the session.
- [End of Session Routine]({{% relref "End of Session Routine" %}})
