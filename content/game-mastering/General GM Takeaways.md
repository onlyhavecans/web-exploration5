## Specific to Me
- Corral the players more, keep them on topic
    - especially during setup
- Make the one shot setup faster!
- Organize my Ref sheets/GM table!
- Make an NPC card for me too!

## General
- Don't get lost in my descriptions; give chars just enough.
- Describe the room and establish where people are regularly
- Don't speak over the players but in silences, take a round-robin
- Let the players play, encourage their play.
- Don't be excited to speak as the GM.
- Count to eight on silences and ask players to check in where they are.
- Keep all the player's books up when they talk so I can suggest moves.
- Don't ever call out players in the wrap-up.
- Don't sit in silence during character creation, offer help where needed.
- Have each player post in chat when they are done with the character setup.

## Calling on Players Online
[Calling on individual players online](https://slyflourish.com/calling_on_players.html)

**Address the character, not the player.**

Ask the individuals "Name, what do you think of the situation?" instead of asking the group overall "what do you do."

Ask the character "what do you think" instead of "What do you do" to give people a chance to talk it out.

Keep a list of the characters and players in front of you when running your games to remind you who you haven't heard from in some time.

Let the _next_ character know that we'll be asking them next.

**Let players know we'll be doing this**, and why.
