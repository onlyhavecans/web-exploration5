By participating in this server/games, you agree to the following code of conduct (stolen shamelessly from the Lodestone game community in Minneapolis):

Nobody shows up for a game with the goal of feeling uncomfortable or unsafe, but open play brings together many different types of people with different expectations and approaches to playing. So we've set ground rules that everyone can recognize and follow, resulting in better games and more fun for everyone.

All participants (players, Game Masters, and admin/moderators) are expected to adhere to these rules.
Participants must conduct themselves in a manner that is conducive to the enjoyment and safety of others at the event.
Follow the directions of server admins and moderators.
Follow the GM's lead, and avoid arguing with the GM or other players over rules.
Let other players speak, avoid talking over others.
Allow other players to get attention from the GM.
Be attentive to the table, and don't distract other players.
Respect and abide by content decisions, lines, veils, X-cards, and other safety tools at the table.
Be upfront with your expectations. If you have a particular theme you wish to avoid, talk to your GM.

There is zero tolerance for theft or aggressive behavior.
Abusive and aggressive behavior is grounds for immediate removal.
Aggressive behavior includes threats of or actual physical aggression, using racial, gender, cultural, or other slurs against another person, and otherwise harassing other people. This also includes actions taking place outside the server, both online and in person.

Participants who feel as though they are in an unsafe environment should notify an admin, moderator, or server owner immediately.
Participants noticing disruptive behavior should make those responsible for the behavior aware of their actions. Say something.
Participants will never be retaliated against by admins or moderators for reporting conduct issues.

If someone feels uncomfortable bringing it to the attention of the disruptive individual, the participant should notify the Game Master or an admin or moderator immediately.

The Game Master has the right to ask a disruptive player to leave the table and speak with an admin or moderator. Admins and moderators have the right to remove a disruptive or aggressive player or Game Master from the server.

These rules may change as needed.
