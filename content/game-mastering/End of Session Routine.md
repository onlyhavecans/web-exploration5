When you have about an hour left in your session, work towards a dramatic moment that can serve as a climax for the session.

Let players know that I like to do a three-part end-of-session breakdown.

## Per Character Epilogue
Let each player riff for two minutes at the end of any episode, season, or one-shot.

## End-of-session Experience
_Based on the game, read the notes._
[FATE](games/FATE)
[Thirsty Sword Lesbians](Thirsty Sword Lesbians)
[Monster of the Week](Monster of the Week)

## Decompression
Let players know the three steps before we go around the room.

1. Highlight Reel
    1. What was your or your character's highlight moment?
2. Bloopers & Outtakes
    1. Bloopers are the Haha, whoopsie moments
    2. Outtakes are more serious things we want to offer feedback for hopes of improvement
3. Feels & Final Feedback
    1. Time to process and feels
    2. And Get the last word in

## End of Season
Ask players on a scale of 1-5;

1. how in control of their characters they felt
2. How In control of the party did they feel they had
3. How much control over the plot?
4. How much control of the world?
