This is the same information I use on [StartPlaying.Games](https://startplaying.games).
But I have it here for reference.

## Introduction
My Introduction to tabletop games happened when D&D 3.5 came out. This big display was at my favorite Borders I visited on my work break. I bought a special edition with the player's guide, GM guide, and an entire campaign in a box that included maps and tiles you could use to change and expand them.

I learned two things that year. The first was that I naturally gravitated toward a GM role. The second lesson I learned was that I don't care for the genre of high-fantasy, dungeons, or dragons.

I found other systems for building scenarios in other genres like FATE and sometimes GURPS, but I have recently fallen in love with Powered by the Apocalypse games and am using every excuse to buy them, run them, and play in them.

Helping players navigate these fictional worlds and their challenges is one of my favorite past times, followed second only by joining games as a player myself.

I prefer fictional engagement games to system engagement games which is why PbtA and FATE are my gotos for playing games. However, I also have plenty of love for VtM and WtA.

## GM Profile
Hello, welcome to my profile. I have been game mastering since I first got into TTRPGs in '03; most of my time with TTRPGs has been spent being a game master.

I started with the release of D&D 3.5. and quickly transitioned to mostly running GURPS as my favorite system since it was more flexible for playing my worlds. However, I have long since moved into preferring games based more on fictional engagement than system engagement.

I prefer to run Fate Core for heavy powers & awesomeness and Powered by the Apocalypse games like Thirsty Sword Lesbians and Monster of the Week for messier and more emotional games. It is unusual to find combat-oriented games at my table as I prefer mystery, thrillers, horror, and politics to any brawler. I adore indie games and am always interested in fun, wacky, and zany one-shots or short campaigns. I always have far more games that I have backed or purchased than I have been able to play.

Outside of games, I am an avid roleplayer and love collaborative storytelling and writing. Navigating fictional worlds and exploring characters and their challenges is one of my favorite past times. I hope you will join me for it!

I use Roll20 as the virtual tabletop and Discord for chat, audio, and video. I prefer "video on," but I understand and respect when that is not desired. I live in Las Vegas and am also available for in-person games.

Safety tools are essential to me; All games start with Lines & Veils and have the X Card. I also support using Script Change and Open Door, which ensures that someone can leave or take a break for any reason without being judged.

I am a queer & trans woman, and this shapes the worlds I help create with players. While not all games I run are themed around queer liberation, you should expect the normalization of queer, PoC, and differently-abled lifestyles. Themes like sexism, racism, ableism, and various phobias will generally not be included unless villanized.
