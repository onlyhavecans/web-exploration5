Welcome to my gaming notes!

This is a collection of all my table top RPG notes and campaign notes from 2017 and forward. I decided to make this open to share my collection of thoughts and notes on different games and to make sessions information available to players.

## [Games](games/)
Here are all of my notes on various tabletop game systems I run and play in.

## [Game Mastering](game-mastering/)
Here are notes on how I GM.

## [My Campaigns](campaigns/)
In here are campaign and session notes from all of my games. This section is primarily for other players in my games, but feel free to read out stories!
