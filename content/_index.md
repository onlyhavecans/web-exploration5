Welcome to my gaming notes!

This is a collection of all my table top RPG notes and campaign notes from 2017 and forward. I decided to make this open to share my collection of thoughts and notes on different games and to make sessions information available to players.

## [Games](games/)

Here are all of my notes on various tabletop game systems I run and play in.

Here are notes on how I GM.

## [My Campaigns](campaigns/)

In here are campaign and session notes from all of my games. This section is primarily for other players in my games, but feel free to read out stories!

## [Player Campaigns](player/)

I take notes for games I am player in too!

## [Idea Pile](idea-pile/)

This is where I work on ideas for upcoming campaigns or sessions. So beware spoilers
