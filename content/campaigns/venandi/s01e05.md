Shiro and Morgan are going to get her back!

Agata awakens without powers!?
"Mary Ann" (real name Heidi) comes in for an assist

Violet is trying to use The Mind's Eye to gain her own psychic powers, at great risk! Agata has always been holding onto an extremely important relic

## The Characters
All of them
Violet: changeling daughter of the king of fairie
Mary Ann from the Night's Cross Motel

## What's Happening Now
## Notes & Takeaways
Morgan and Shoro signed a contract that gives their oath to Violet who is now queen of the fairy
Heidi is super drugged up but kinda knows about the contract
Violet gave up Agata for half of the contract, and the contract is that they get to go back.

Agata decides last minute to bolt out and try to escape into Faery instead of going home

Violet still has the Mind's Eye
