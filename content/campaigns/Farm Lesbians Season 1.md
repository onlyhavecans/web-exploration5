[Farm Lesbians World Building Worksheet]({{% relref "Farm Lesbians World Building Worksheet" %}})

## Setting
You were all involved in the conflicts in a strife-filled land. I will let you all come up with your backstories, but the short of it is that the powers from your shared nation have decided it's time for more peace and are giving out "free early retirements" in farmland. You don't have to be a combatant per se. Still, you are generally involved: medic, chef, strategist, noble who was a bit too fingers into things… whatever you can think of that you can justify that you were "involved enough" to qualify to be sent off to farm in the prime of your life to get you away from the battlefield.

You lot all have your own reasons, but collectively, you have come together and decided you want to set down swords and pick up plowshares in the lesbian farming commune known as Stardew Valley and have been given an old farm to share.

Integrating into a small community and starting a farm is hardly an easy retirement, especially when there is more than meets the eye in this small town…
