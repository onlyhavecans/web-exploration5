## Setting
Forest City of Shawboa

A metropolitan forest city with homes mixed between the earth and spreading high amongst the branches.

The city is built upon one of the largest magical leylines, a well of nature magic so powerful that it spreads through the whole city and infuses all we do with magic.

All sorts of various creatures and people call this their home, all gathering to be in one of the most magical places in the forest continent known as the Ammore Verdant.

You are all members of the Shawboa Mail Brigade, a parcel and mail delivery funded by the city to provide for its citizens.

## Major Issues
1. The leyline has been poisoned and is starting to die **hidden**
2. Magical communication is disrupted
3. The Elementals Mail Company is trying to steal the magic & take over the city

## Impending Issues
1. Suddenly, you are all super overworked! So much to do!
2. The team sees something they shouldn't have! Elemental's people
