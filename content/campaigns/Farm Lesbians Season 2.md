## Setting
You were all involved in the conflicts in a strife-filled land. I will let you all come up with your backstories, but the short of it is that the powers from your shared nation have decided it's time for more peace and are giving out "free early retirements" in farmland. You don't have to be a combatant per se. Still, you are generally involved: medic, chef, strategist, noble who was a bit too fingers into things… whatever you can think of that you can justify that you were "involved enough" to qualify to be sent off to farm in the prime of your life to get you away from the battlefield.

You lot all have your own reasons, but collectively, you have come together and decided you want to set down swords and pick up plowshares in the lesbian farming commune known as Stardew Valley and have been given an old farm to share.

Integrating into a small community and starting a farm is hardly an easy retirement, especially when there is more than meets the eye in this small town…

## Major Issues
## Impending Issues

After spending the time in his cage dorian is taken for a walk, literally on a collar and leash.
Vixen was out shopping, after having walked past Patty's Corner Store and gone right to Joja for meat. However she ran into Mora and Dorian and picked a fight with Mora. before this escalated too far Vixen took off

Meanwhile Maru & Dr winters are doing well, their relationship blooming as they learn more about each other as they have grown. Maru is still working the front desk and now Dr Winters is working full time at the clinic.

However the clinic shares a wall with Patty's corner store and the raging Vixen causes a fight so loud Dr Winters goes over to ty and smooth things over. Even though Patty is being shitty to Vixen the Doc manager to deescalate the situation but in her simmering anger Vixen offers to help Patty deal with Joja mart and Mora. Patty offers Vixen to help her, and meet her at the bar to talk about it. Things still end up getting super messy when Mora and Dorian show up to throw shade on Patty and talk about how Joja mart is throwing a sale.

---

Vixen gets to the bar early to see Emily since she is working there. However when Vixen tells Emily about her plans to work with Patty to sabotage Joja and Mora it turns into a bit of a fight, where Emily isn't going to support Vixen with this bloodlust and vengeance and she will need to pick.
Vixen changes her mind about wanting to help Patty and instead causes a scene telling her off hard in the bar.

---

The next morning Mora has an appointment at headquarters so Dorian is home for once in a long time. He is starving and makes a huge breakfast and tries to understand how messy everything has been. However when everybody is coming in to have breakfast Luise shows up and and they learn somebody vandalized the Patty's shop and vixen is at the top of the list of suspects after the huge outbursts at the bar. After questioning Dr Winters and Vixen while Dorian hid the three have a tense conversation about who it could be.

Dr Winters leaves for work but Vixen stays behind with dorian. They have a hard conversation and Vixen really puts Dorian that he is really failing his patron and not ready for the Spirits Even and they decide to go get his instruments. They realize that they are at Mora and after breaking into Mora house they find them in the dark corner of the closet, and dorian has a bit of concern but still is bottling some. Finally Vixen completely looses her cool about the whole situation with Mora and Dorian and completely dumps on them.

Mora shows up while vixen is dumping on Mora and then snaps at Vixen. Dorian runs to his cage like a dog that realized he is in trobuble but Vixen shifts and steals the guitars, running through town and to the clinic to get Dr Winters.
When Dr Winters sees this though she decides it's fighting time and they take it it to Mora. WInters pick the fight but Vixen comes in ti take them.

Dorian is found upstairs bleeding and chained to a St Andrews cross, he's too beaten to stand but Winters unties them and carries them away. Downstairs the fight with Vixen and Mora is getting messy but when Dr Winters carries Dorian out, Mora stops and actually calls Dorian by his name, and says

> Dorian, don't you go out that door, you can't leave me.
